### Objective

Diabetes is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The Pima Indians tribe presents an interesting case study as they have a high prevalence of diabetes. This report aims to explore the dataset and develop a predictive model to forecast diabetes outcomes in the tribe. Here, we are going to analyze different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Analysis to predict the Outcome based on input features.

### Data Dictionary

•	Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

•	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

•	Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

•	Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

•	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

•	BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

•	DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

•	Age: Age in years.

•	Outcome: Class variable (0: a person is not diabetic or 1: a person is diabetic).

### Visualization

Boxplot: Boxplots are excellent for visualizing the distribution of numeric variables and identifying outliers.
Pair plot: Pair plots are helpful for exploring relationships between pairs of variables, making them useful for initial data exploration.
Heat map: Heat maps can reveal correlations between variables, allowing you to identify patterns and dependencies.
Scatterplot: Scatterplots are effective for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables, which can be essential for understanding how variables interact in the context of diabetes outcomes.

### Summary

In conclusion, the study demonstrated the importance of data preparation, exploration, modeling, and evaluation in healthcare data analysis. The use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib enabled efficient data exploration and modeling, and the findings provide valuable insights into the factors affecting diabetes. Further research can expand on this work by exploring more advanced machine learning techniques and incorporating additional variables to improve model accuracy.
