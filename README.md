### SuperKart Sales Prediction
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates the total sales for each SuperKart outlet for the upcoming quarter. This model will help the organization in strategic planning, inventory management, and optimizing sales operations in various city tiers. By understanding the key drivers of sales in different store types and locations, SuperKart can make informed decisions to boost profitability and customer satisfaction.

###  Architectural Design Presentation 

Data Ingestion
Kafka acts as a high-throughput streaming platform, ingesting real-time credit card transactions, account logins, and other relevant data.
NiFi ingests historical data from various sources like transaction logs, customer profiles, and external fraud intelligence feeds into HDFS, the distributed storage system.
  Data Processing
Spark Utilizes YARN, the resource manager, to run parallel processing tasks on HDFS data. Spark analyzes transactions, identifying anomalies and suspicious patterns through machine learning algorithms.
Hive Enables querying of historical data stored in HDFS using SQL-like syntax. Analysts can identify trends and patterns across historical data to refine fraud detection models.
HBase Stores real-time data with low latency for fast lookups. Spark can access HBase for real-time enrichment of transaction data with customer information or past fraud flags.
Fraud Detection & Alerting  
Solr Indexes enriched transaction data, enabling fast search and retrieval by analysts investigating flagged transactions.
Alerting: When a transaction is flagged as fraudulent, alerts are sent to security teams in real-time using Kafka or other notification systems.
Interactive Analysis: Hive and Solr enable analysts to interactively explore data, validate alerts, and investigate suspicious activities using tools like Tableau or Kibana.

## Titanic Survival Predictions   

This project aims to understand and predict survival rates during maritime disasters, using the
Titanic tragedy as a case study. By analyzing passenger data, we seek to identify key factors that
influenced survival chances. This could provide insights for modern maritime safety protocols and
evacuation strategies, enhancing passenger safety in current and future maritime travel. The
objective of this problem is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of
people were more likely to survive?” using the passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socioeconomic
class and more.).

## CurrencyApi  

This API provides access to real-time currency exchange rates. It offers information on exchange rates between different currencies, such as USD, EUR, GBP, etc., which can be used to analyze sales data in different currencies. The Currency Conversion API is a powerful tool for handling exchange rate conversions in data science projects. This API offers current and historical foreign exchange rates, providing accurate and up-to-date currency conversion data. It eliminates the need to worry about uptime or outdated information, ensuring reliable access to the latest rates.
