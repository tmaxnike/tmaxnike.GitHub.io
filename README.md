Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains various data science projects I've worked on, showcasing a range of topics and techniques. Feel free to explore the folders and dive into each project.
### Project Groups 
###Visualizations
1 ##Diabetes Analysis  
###Boxplot: Boxplots are excellent for visualizing the distribution of numeric variables and identifying outliers.
###Pair plot: Pair plots are helpful for exploring relationships between pairs of variables, making them useful for initial data exploration.
###Heat map: Heat maps can reveal correlations between variables, allowing you to identify patterns and dependencies.
###Scatterplot: Scatterplots are effective for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables, which can be essential for understanding how variables interact in the context of diabetes outcomes.
