Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

Topic:
“Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction: Leveraging Data Science for Revenue Optimization"

Context:
The hospitality industry faces a persistent challenge with booking cancellations, significantly impacting revenue streams. INN Hotels Group, operating in Portugal, confronts this issue and seeks data-driven solutions. As a data scientist, your task is to analyze booking data to identify factors influencing cancellations, develop predictive models, and formulate strategies to mitigate revenue loss.

Business Problem:
Hotel cancellations pose multifaceted challenges, including revenue loss, increased distribution costs, and resource allocation inefficiencies. The objective is to predict booking cancellations accurately, enabling proactive measures to minimize revenue loss and optimize operational efficiency.
Data Description:
The dataset comprises various booking attributes, including guest demographics, reservation details, and historical booking behavior. Attributes include the number of guests, meal plans, parking requirements, lead time, market segment, and previous cancellation history, among others.

Methodology:
The project will undertake the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand the distribution of key variables, correlations, and trends related to booking cancellations.
3. Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features influencing cancellation behavior, such as lead time, previous cancellations, and special requests.
4. Model Selection and Training: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) for binary classification to predict booking cancellations.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve. Emphasize recall to minimize false negatives, crucial for identifying potential cancellations.
6. Model Optimization: Implement techniques such as cross-validation, hyper parameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV), and ensemble methods to enhance model performance and generalization.


Ethical Considerations:
Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR), mitigate biases in model predictions, and prioritize transparency in model decisions.

Challenges/Issues:
The project will likely encounter several challenges, including but not limited to:
1. Dealing with imbalanced datasets, where canceled bookings may be a minority class.
2. Avoiding over fitting to ensure models generalize well to new data.
3. Addressing the dynamic nature of booking behavior influenced by external factors like economic conditions and travel restrictions.
