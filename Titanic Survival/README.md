This project aims to understand and predict survival rates during maritime disasters, using the
Titanic tragedy as a case study. By analyzing passenger data, we seek to identify key factors that
influenced survival chances. This could provide insights for modern maritime safety protocols and
evacuation strategies, enhancing passenger safety in current and future maritime travel. The
objective of this problem is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of
people were more likely to survive?” using the passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socioeconomic
class and more.).
